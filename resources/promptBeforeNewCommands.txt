Consider the following phrases:
- Seat forward
- Seat backward
- Seat up
- Seat down
- Backrest forward
- Backrest backward
- Seat tighter
- Seat looser

Furthermore, consider a value between 0 and 255 for each of the above phrases.
Near 0 means only a little bit and the closer to 255, the more.
For example, "Move the seat a bit forward" would be: "Seat forward" with a value of 30.
"Move the seat completely forward" would be: "Seat forward" with a value of 255.

Additionally, consider the following modes to be selectable by the user:
- Relax mode
- Driving mode
- Sleeping mode

Which one(if any) is closest to the following phrase in my next message and by how much?
