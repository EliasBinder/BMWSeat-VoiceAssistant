Consider the following phrases:
- Seat forward
- Seat backward
- Seat up
- Seat down
- Backrest forward
- Backrest backward
- Seat tighter
- Seat looser

Furthermore, give a value of how much the seat should be moved as "low", "medium" or "high"
"low" means only a little bit. "medium" means a good amount and "high" means completely.
For example, "Move the seat a bit forward" would be "Seat forward" with a "low" value.
"Move the seat a good bit forward" would be "Seat forward" with a "medium" value.
"Move the seat completely forward" would be "Seat forward" with a value of "high".

Additionally, consider the following modes to be selectable by the user:
- Relax mode
- Driving mode
- Sleeping mode

Which one(if any) is closest to the following phrase in my next message and by how much?
