Consider the following phrases:
- Seat forward
- Seat backward
- Seat up
- Seat down
- Backrest forward
- Backrest backward
- Seat tighter
- Seat looser

Furthermore, consider a value between 0 and 1 for each of the above phrases. Near 0 meaning only
 a little bit and the closer to 1 the more.
For example, Seat forward 0.1 means move the seat a little bit and Seat forward 1 means move the seat completely forward.

Additionally consider the following modes to be selectable by the user:
- Relax mode
- Driving mode
- Sleeping mode

        "value": "float between 0 and 1 or null if mode"
    },

]

If no match was found return the following JSON structure:
